# IPv4 Server & IPv6 Client Project

## Description

This project implements a hybrid **IPv4 server / IPv6 client** application written in C, designed for a networking lab. <br>
The Linux-based server listens for commands from a Windows client over IPv4 sockets. Upon receiving a valid command (`xy#`), the server connects to a public IPv6 web server and retrieves a webpage, saving the content locally and sending it back to the original client.

## Functionalities

- Listens for TCP connections on port `22214`
- Accepts commands in the format `xy#` from clients
- If the command is known (e.g., `12#`), it:
  - Establishes an IPv6 TCP connection to the corresponding server
  - Sends an HTTP GET request
  - Saves the response as `index.html`
  - Sends the response back to the IPv4 client
- If the command is unknown -> returns: `"Comanda neimplementata."`
- Logs each clientâ€™s IP and port in `log.txt`

## Requirements
- Linux with IPv6 support
- GCC compiler
